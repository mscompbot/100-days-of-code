**Today's Progress**: Exploring new things with python

**Thoughts** Just experimenting with some python functions and in-line loops. I attempted this challenge from twitter. Links below

### Day 4: 13 July, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on setting the dates

**Thoughts** Today was a good coding day. I managed to figure out how to use classes. I had an error with more arguments being passed in the __init__ section but managed to fix it using some stack overfl0w and W3Schools. I also read the documentation for the datetime python library which enabled me to compare dates and transorm user input into a date format. I want it to only recognise the month and day but will do that in future. I need to add some validation to the code to ensure the user enters in an actual date in the correct format.

### Day 3: 12 July, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting my first project

**Thoughts** Today I began my first project. I want to create a horoscope compatibility calculator. Firstly the user enters their star sign and their partners star sign and the program will generate the percentage compatibility. The user can select whether it is a love, frienship or professional relationship and the program will calculate how compatible they are.

### Day 2: 11 July, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Data Analysis

**Thoughts** Today I began the Data Analysis course on Free Code Camp. So far it is really good. I'm finding I'm daunted by how complicated it seems at first then my head gets around it and it seems pretty intuitive. 

I began the lecuture work for lecture 1 and will carry on tomorrow. Just need to figure out how to stop those ellipses coming when I'm trying to view the data.

### Day 1: 10 July, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Tried the calculator again!

**Thoughts** So after the blunder with Qt and trying to get it working on REPLIT I decided to make the calculator using Tkinter which was easy enough! I used the Geeks for Geeks template. I have decided that I would like to look into data architecture so that is what I will focus on for my inital projects - data and databases.

### Day 0: 09 July, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to start trying to make a calculator and explore Python GUI

**Thoughts** Today did not go well. Could not get pqqt to work with REPLIT and output anything at all. This has made me feel like this is too complicated for me. Ill try again tomorrow.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
