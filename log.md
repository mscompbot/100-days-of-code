### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: 09 July, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to start trying to make a calculator and explore Python GUI

**Thoughts** Today did not go well. Could not get pqqt to work with REPLIT and output anything at all. This has made me feel like this is too complicated for me. Ill try again tomorrow.
